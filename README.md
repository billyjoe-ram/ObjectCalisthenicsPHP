# Object Calisthenics

## What is it?
Object Calisthenics, first introduced by Jeff Bay in his book "The ThoughtWorks Anthology", is a set of 9 basic rules applied to exercises, proposed
to improve the code in a software written with a OOP (Object Oriented Programming) paradigm, well grounded by the concepts known as "clean code".

Though no developer is obligated to follow the rules proposed in the exercises, the hability of writing code that is maintainable, readable, testable,
and comprehensible, will be tested an improved each time these concepts are thought of and taken in consideration.

## The repository
This repo' was created during an Alura course in 2022, wich the link can be acessed
[here](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/object-calisthenics-exercitando-orientacao-objetos).

Despite the language chosen being PHP, any other that has objects or even similar adaptions using functions can help in the process of abstracting similar
concepts, expressing intents of the code and testing to ensure reliability.
